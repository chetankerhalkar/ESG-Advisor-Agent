CHALLENGES & AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. Carbon Neutrality Claims: While we have committed to carbon neutrality by 2030, we acknowledge the need for third-party verification of our emissions data and reduction methodologies. We will engage Bureau Veritas for independent audit in 2025.

2. Supply Chain Transparency: Limited visibility into Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers presents risks for labor rights and environmental compliance. We are investing $2.5M in supply chain mapping technology.

3. Executive Pay Equity: Gender pay gap persists in executive compensation (15% differential). Remediation plan includes compensation review, market benchmarking, and equity adjustments by Q2 2025.

4. Waste Diversion: Current 50% waste diversion rate falls short of our 75% target. Implementing advanced sorting technology and circular economy partnerships.
